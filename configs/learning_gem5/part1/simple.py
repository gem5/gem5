""" This file creates a barebones system and executes 'hello', a simple Hello
World application.
See Part 1, Chapter 2: Creating a simple configuration script in the
learning_gem5 book for more information about this script.

IMPORTANT: If you modify this file, it's likely that the Learning gem5 book
           also needs to be updated. For now, email Jason <power.jg@gmail.com>

This script uses the X86 ISA. `simple-arm.py` and `simple-riscv.py` may be
referenced as examples of scripts which utilize the ARM and RISC-V ISAs
respectively.
