Learning_gem README
-------------------
This directory contains the configuration scripts used in the "Learning gem5"
book. The scripts contained in these directories are for educational purposes
only and should not be used for architectural research as-is.

"Learning gem5" is a work-in-progress book that is frequently updated. For the
most up-to-date version of the book, see the website.

http://gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/introduction

This directory is broken into one subdirectory per part of the book.

If you would like to contribute (please do!) the code for the Learning gem5 book
is hosted on GitHub.

Goals of these scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These scripts are not necessarily useful outside the scope of the Learning
gem5 book. The goal is to include the learning gem5 scripts, following the
book as closely as possible, so that the regression tester will catch any
changes that affect the book.

For general users, these are *not* good scripts to use for running complex
architectural experiments. These scripts *are* a good starting point example
of how to write your own scripts for experiments.
