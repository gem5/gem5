A simple run file that creates two SimObjects: HelloObject and GoodbyeObject
and then runs the simulation. Using the debug "Hello" is informative.

IMPORTANT: If you modify this file, it's likely that the Learning gem5 book
           also needs to be updated. For now, email Jason <power.jg@gmail.com>
