This gem5 configuation script creates a simple board to run an ARM
"hello world" binary using the DRAMSys simulator.

**Important Note**: DRAMSys must be compiled into the gem5 binary to use the
DRRAMSys simulator. Please consult 'ext/dramsys/README' on how to compile
correctly. If this is not done correctly this script will run with error.
