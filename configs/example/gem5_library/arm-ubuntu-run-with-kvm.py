This script further shows an example of booting an ARM based full system Ubuntu
disk image. This simulation boots the disk image using 2 TIMING CPU cores. The
simulation ends when the startup is completed successfully (i.e. when an
`m5_exit instruction is reached on successful boot).

Usage
-----

```
scons build/ARM/gem5.opt -j<NUM_CPUS>
./build/ARM/gem5.opt configs/example/gem5_library/arm-ubuntu-run-with-kvm.py
```
