This script shows an example of running a full system RISCV Ubuntu boot
simulation using the gem5 library. This simulation boots Ubuntu 20.04 using
2 TIMING CPU cores. The simulation ends when the startup is completed
successfully.

Usage
-----

```
scons build/RISCV/gem5.opt
./build/RISCV/gem5.opt \
    configs/example/gem5_library/riscv-ubuntu-run.py
