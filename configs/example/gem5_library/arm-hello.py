This gem5 configuation script creates a simple board to run an ARM
"hello world" binary.

This is setup is the close to the simplest setup possible using the gem5
library. It does not contain any kind of caching, IO, or any non-essential
components.

Usage
-----

```
scons build/ARM/gem5.opt
./build/ARM/gem5.opt configs/example/gem5_library/arm-hello.py
