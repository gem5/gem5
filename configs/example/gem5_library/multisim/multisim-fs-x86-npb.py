"""An example of a single configuration script for defining multiple
simulations through the gem5 `multisim` module.

This script creates 6 full system simulations by interating through a suite
of benchmarks and different cores counts.

Usage
-----

1. To run all the simulations defined in this script::

```shell
<gem5-binary> -m gem5.utils.multisim \
    configs/example/gem5_library/multisim/multisim-fs-x86-npb.py
```

2. To run a specific simulation defined in this script:

```shell
<gem5-binary> configs/example/gem5_library/multisim/multisim-fs-x86-npb.py \
    <process_id> # e.g. npb-bt-a_cores-1
```

3. To list all the IDs of the simulations defined in this script:

```shell
<gem5-binary> configs/example/gem5_library/multisim/multisim-fs-x86-npb.py -l
```
