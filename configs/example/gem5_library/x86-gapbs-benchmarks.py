"""
Script to run GAPBS benchmarks with gem5. The script expects the
benchmark program and the simulation size to run. The input is in the format
<benchmark_prog> <size> <synthetic>
The system is fixed with 2 CPU cores, MESI Two Level system cache and 3 GB
DDR4 memory. It uses the x86 board.

This script will count the total number of instructions executed
in the ROI. It also tracks how much wallclock and simulated time.

Usage:
------

```
scons build/X86/gem5.opt
./build/X86/gem5.opt \
    configs/example/gem5_library/x86-gabps-benchmarks.py \
    --benchmark <benchmark_name> \
    --synthetic <synthetic> \
    --size <simulation_size/graph_name>
```
