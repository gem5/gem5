"""
Script to run NAS parallel benchmarks with gem5. The script expects the
benchmark program to run. The input is in the format
<benchmark_prog>.<class>.x .The system is fixed with 2 CPU cores, MESI
Two Level system cache and 3 GB DDR4 memory. It uses the x86 board.

This script will count the total number of instructions executed
in the ROI. It also tracks how much wallclock and simulated time.

Usage:
------

```
scons build/X86/gem5.opt
./build/X86/gem5.opt \
    configs/example/gem5_library/x86-npb-benchmarks.py \
    --benchmark <benchmark_name> \
    --size <benchmark_class>
