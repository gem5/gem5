"""
Script to run PARSEC benchmarks with gem5.
The script expects a benchmark program name and the simulation
size. The system is fixed with 2 CPU cores, MESI Two Level system
cache and 3 GB DDR4 memory. It uses the x86 board.

This script will count the total number of instructions executed
in the ROI. It also tracks how much wallclock and simulated time.

Usage:
------

```
scons build/X86/gem5.opt
./build/X86/gem5.opt \
    configs/example/gem5_library/x86-parsec-benchmarks.py \
    --benchmark <benchmark_name> \
    --size <simulation_size>
