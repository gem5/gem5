This example runs a simple linux boot. It uses the 'riscv-disk-img' resource.
It is built with the sources in `src/riscv-fs` in [gem5 resources](
https://github.com/gem5/gem5-resources).

Characteristics
---------------

* Runs exclusively on the RISC-V ISA with the classic caches
* Assumes that the kernel is compiled into the bootloader
* Automatically generates the DTB file
* Will boot but requires a user to login using `m5term` (username: `root`,
  password: `root`)
