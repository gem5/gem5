This script is used for testing the event_event handler of the Simulator
module. If the handler is working correctly the following output will be
received:

```
The program has started!
About to exit the simulation for the 1 st/nd/rd/th time
Handled exit event.
build/X86/sim/simulate.cc:194: info: Entering event queue @ 780559326.  Starting simulation...
About to exit the simulation for the 2 st/nd/rd/th time
Handled exit event.
build/X86/sim/simulate.cc:194: info: Entering event queue @ 854152659.  Starting simulation...
About to exit the simulation for the 3 st/nd/rd/th time
Handling the final exit event. We'll exit now.
```

By default a generator is passed to define the exit_event behavior. A list of
functions or a lone function can also be passed. This can be specified by the
`--exit-event-type` parameter.
