This gem5 configuation script creates a simple board sharing the same
structure as the one in
tests/gem5/checkpoint-tests/x86-fs-save-checkpoint.py.
This script restores the checkpoint generated by the above script, and
runs the rest of full system simulation.
This configuration serves as a test of restoring a checkpoint with X86 ISA in fs mode.
