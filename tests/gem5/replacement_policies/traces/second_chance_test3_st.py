# This test is targeting stores.
# access pattern: A, C, E, G, A, C, E, G, E, I, A, C, G, E
# Each letter represents a 64-byte address range.
# The [] indicate two different sets, and each set has four ways.
# [set0way0, set0way1, set0way2, set0way3],
# [set1way0, set1way1, set1way2, set1way3],
# If you have a 512B cache with 4-way associativity,
# and each cache line is 64B. This test can be used to test the correctness of Second Chance
# replacement policy. The Second Chance replacement policy will keep the block
# 'A' and 'C' in the cache because of the second chance bit. More specifically,
# with Second Chance replacement policy, you will observe:
# m, m, m, m, h, h, h, h, h, m, m, m, h, m, h where 'm' means miss, and 'h' means hit.
# Explanation of the result:
# A, C, E, G are misses. The cache stores ([A0, C0, E0, G0],[ , , ,]).
# The number after each letter is the second chance bit, which would be set after a re-reference.
# A, C, E, G are hit. Now the cache stores ([A1, C1, E1, G1],[ , , ,]).
# E hits.
# I searches a victim and selects A. Now the cache stores ([I0, C0, E0, G0],[ , , ,]).
# A searches a victim and selects C. Now the cache stores ([I0, A0, E0, G0],[ , , ,]).
# C searches a victim and selects E. Now the cache stores ([I0, A0, C0, G0],[ , , ,]).
# G hits.
# E searches a victim and selects I. Now the cache stores ([E0, A0, C0, G0],[ , , ,]).
# G hits
