/**
 * Buffered DMA engine helper class
 *
 * This class implements a simple DMA engine that feeds a FIFO
 * buffer. The size of the buffer, the maximum number of pending
 * requests and the maximum request size are all set when the engine
 * is instantiated.
 *
 * An <i>asynchronous</i> transfer of a <i>block</i> of data
 * (designated by a start address and a size) is started by calling
 * the startFill() method. The DMA engine will aggressively try to
 * keep the internal FIFO full. As soon as there is room in the FIFO
 * for more data <i>and</i> there are free request slots, a new fill
 * will be started.
 *
 * Data in the FIFO can be read back using the get() and tryGet()
 * methods. Both request a block of data from the FIFO. However, get()
 * panics if the block cannot be satisfied, while tryGet() simply
 * returns false. The latter call makes it possible to implement
 * custom buffer underrun handling.
 *
 * A simple use case would be something like this:
 * \code{.cpp}
 *     // Create a DMA engine with a 1KiB buffer. Issue up to 8 concurrent
 *     // uncacheable 64 byte (maximum) requests.
 *     DmaReadFifo *dma = new DmaReadFifo(port, 1024, 64, 8,
 *                                        Request::UNCACHEABLE);
 *
 *     // Start copying 4KiB data from 0xFF000000
 *     dma->startFill(0xFF000000, 0x1000);
 *
 *     // Some time later when there is data in the FIFO.
 *     uint8_t data[8];
 *     dma->get(data, sizeof(data))
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * The DMA engine allows new blocks to be requested as soon as the
 * last request for a block has been sent (i.e., there is no need to
 * wait for pending requests to complete). This can be queried with
 * the atEndOfBlock() method and more advanced implementations may
 * override the onEndOfBlock() callback.
