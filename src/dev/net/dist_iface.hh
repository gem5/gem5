 * The interface class for dist gem5 simulations.
 *
 * dist-gem5 is an extension to gem5 to enable parallel simulation of a
 * distributed system (e.g. simulation of a pool of machines
 * connected by Ethernet links). A dist gem5 run consists of seperate gem5
 * processes running in parallel. Each gem5 process executes
 * the simulation of a component of the simulated distributed system.
 * (An example component can be a dist-core board with an Ethernet NIC.)
 * The DistIface class below provides services to transfer data and
 * control messages among the gem5 processes. The main such services are
 * as follows.
 *
 * 1. Send a data packet coming from a simulated Ethernet link. The packet
 * will be transferred to (all) the target(s) gem5 processes. The send
 * operation is always performed by the simulation thread, i.e. the gem5
 * thread that is processing the event queue associated with the simulated
 * Ethernet link.
 *
 * 2. Spawn a receiver thread to process messages coming in from the
 * from other gem5 processes. Each simulated Ethernet link has its own
 * associated receiver thread. The receiver thread saves the incoming packet
 * and schedule an appropriate receive event in the event queue.
 *
 * 3. Schedule a global barrier event periodically to keep the gem5
 * processes in sync.
 * Periodic barrier event to keep peer gem5 processes in sync. The basic idea
 * is that no gem5 process can go ahead further than the simulated link
 * transmission delay to ensure that a corresponding receive event can always
 * be scheduled for any message coming in from a peer gem5 process.
 *
 *
 *
 * This interface is an abstract class. It can work with various low level
 * send/receive service implementations (e.g. TCP/IP, MPI,...). A TCP
 * stream socket version is implemented in src/dev/net/tcp_iface.[hh,cc].
