/**
 * VirtIO descriptor (chain) wrapper
 *
 * Communication in VirtIO takes place by sending and receiving chains
 * of so called descriptors using device queues. The queue is
 * responsible for sending a descriptor chain from the guest to the
 * host and later sending it back to the guest. The descriptor chain
 * itself can be thought of as a linked list of buffers (descriptors)
 * that are read only (isIncoming() is true) or write only
 * (isOutgoing() is true). A single chain may contain any mix of input
 * and output buffers.
 *
 * The descriptor wrapper is normally <i>only</i> instantiated by the
 * virtqueue wrapper (VirtQueue) and should never be instantiated in
 * device models. The VirtQueue also ensures that the descriptor
 * wrapper is re-populated with new data from the guest by calling
 * updateChain() whenever a new descriptor chain is passed to the host
 * (VirtQueue::consumeDescriptor()). The updateChain() method
 * automatically does some sanity checks on the descriptor chain to
 * detect loops.
