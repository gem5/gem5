    This prebuilt X86 board is used for demonstration purposes. It simulates
    an X86 3GHz dual-core system with a 3GiB DDR4_2400 memory system. The
    cache hierarchy consists of per-core private L1 instruction and data
    caches (64KiB each) connected to a shared 1MiB L2 cache.

    **DISCLAIMER**: This board is solely for demonstration purposes. This board
    is not known to be representative of any real-world system or produce
    reliable statistical results.

    Example
    -------

    An example of using the X86DemoBoard can be found in
    ``configs/example/gem5_library/x86-ubuntu-run.py``.

    To run:

    .. code-block::

        scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j`nproc`
        ./build/X86/gem5.opt configs/example/gem5_library/x86-ubuntu-run.py
