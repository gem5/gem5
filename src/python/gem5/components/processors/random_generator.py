        This class defines an external interface to create a list of random
        generator cores that could replace the processing cores in a board.

        :param num_cores: The number of linear generator cores to create.
        :param duration: The duration of time for which the generator generates
                         traffic. Must be a string containing a positive number
                         and some unit. For example, "1ms".
        :param rate: The rate at which the synthetic data is read/written.
        :param block_size: The number of bytes to be read/written with each
                           request.
        :param min_addr: The lower bound of the address range the generator
                         will read/write from/to.
        :param max_addr: The upper bound of the address range the generator
                         will read/write from/to.
        :param rd_perc: The percentage of read requests among all the generated
                        requests. The write percentage would be equal to
                        ``100 - rd_perc``.
        :param data_limit: The amount of data in bytes to read/write by the
                           generator before stopping generation. If set to 0,
                           there will be no data limit.
