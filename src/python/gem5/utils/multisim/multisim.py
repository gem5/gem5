"""This module contains the gem5 MultiSim framework. The gem5 MultiSim
work functions by allowing a user to specify multiple simulations to run from
a single gem5 config script. The MuliSim framework will then run these
simulations in parallel using the Python multiprocessing library.

The framework works by having the user add the simulators in a configuration
via the `add_simulator` function, each with a unique, user specified, id. This
adds the different simulations to run in parallel to a global list. The
MultiSim framework then uses the Python multiprocessing library to run the
simulations in parallel by loading the config script as a module in each child
process and then selecting the simulation to run via the iid in the global set
of scheduled simulators jobs to run.
The only difference between the child processes is the id of the simulator.

Important notes
---------------

1. You cannot load/instantiate the simulators in the main process. You cannot
even load the config script (i.e., `import config_script`). This means the
config script is passed as a string referencing the config script as a module.
This script is then passed to the child processes to load.

2. The config script cannot accept parameters. It must be parameterless.
