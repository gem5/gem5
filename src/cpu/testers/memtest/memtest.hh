 * and writes a specific byte in a cache line, as determined by its
 * unique id. Thus, all requests issued by the MemTest instance are a
 * single byte and a specific address is only ever touched by a single
 * tester.
 *
 * In addition to verifying the data, the tester also has timeouts for
 * both requests and responses, thus checking that the memory-system
