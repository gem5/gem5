/**
 * The traffic generator is a module that generates stimuli for
 * the memory system, based on a collection of simple behaviours that
 * are either probabilistic or based on traces. It can be used stand
 * alone for creating test cases for interconnect and memory
 * controllers, or function as a black-box replacement for system
 * components that are not yet modelled in detail, e.g. a video engine
 * or baseband subsystem in an SoC.
 *
 * The traffic generator has a single request port that is used to send
 * requests, independent of the specific behaviour. The behaviour of
 * the traffic generator is specified in a configuration file, and this
 * file describes a state transition graph where each state is a
 * specific generator behaviour. Examples include idling, generating
 * linear address sequences, random sequences and replay of captured
 * traces. By describing these behaviours as states, it is straight
 * forward to create very complex behaviours, simply by arranging them
 * in graphs. The graph transitions can also be annotated with
 * probabilities, effectively making it a Markov Chain.
