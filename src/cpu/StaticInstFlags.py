# Set of boolean static instruction properties.
#
# Notes:
# - The IsInteger and IsFloating flags are based on the class of registers
# accessed by the instruction.  Although most instructions will have exactly
# one of these two flags set, it is possible for an instruction to have
# neither (e.g., direct unconditional branches, memory barriers) or both
# (e.g., an FP/int conversion).
# - If IsControl is set, then exactly one of IsDirectControl or IsIndirect
# Control will be set, and exactly one of IsCondControl or IsUncondControl
# will be set.
