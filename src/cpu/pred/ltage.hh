/* @file
 * Implementation of a L-TAGE branch predictor. TAGE is a global-history based
 * branch predictor. It features a PC-indexed bimodal predictor and N
 * partially tagged tables, indexed with a hash of the PC and the global
 * branch history. The different lengths of global branch history used to
 * index the partially tagged tables grow geometrically. A small path history
 * is also used in the hash. L-TAGE also features a loop predictor that records
 * iteration count of loops and predicts accordingly.
 *
 * All TAGE tables are accessed in parallel, and the one using the longest
 * history that matches provides the prediction (some exceptions apply).
 * Entries are allocated in components using a longer history than the
 * one that predicted when the prediction is incorrect.
