# pre-commit, as installed via apt in 24.04, attempts to create a cache
# directory at "${HOME}/.cache/pre-commit". If running docker with non-root,
# the HOME directory is set to "/". Since non-root users do not have permission
# to write to this directory, an error is returned when pre-commit is executed.
# pre-commit's default cache directory can be changed via the `XDG_CACHE_HOME`
# enivoronment variable. Here we set it to "/tmp". With this pre-commit will
# create a "/tmp/pre-commit" directory to use for caching. "/tmp" was chosen
# as it's a directory any user can access and write to. Given this only stores
# caching information, the "/tmp" directory being wiped is not a concern.
ENV XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/
