# This Dockerfile creates a devcontainer for gem5 development referenced in
# ./devcontainer/devcontainer.json. The devcontainer is a multi-platform
# container that can be built for x86, arm, and riscv and includes all
# dependencies required for gem5 development.
#
# As this is a multi-platform image, we must build it using the
# "docker-bake.hcl" specification via `docker buildx`. To do so, execute the
# following:
#
# `docker buildx bake devcontainer --push`

# Stage 1: We build the stable version of gem5.
# In the final stage this this is copied into /usr/local/bin/gem5. This ensures
# there is a pre-built gem5 binary in each devcontainer. This can save time
# if the container is used for education or demonstration purposes.

RUN scons build/ALL/gem5.opt -j`nproc`

# Stage 2: The final stage where we create the devcontainer image.
# This includes all dependencies for building and running gem5, the
# dependencies for developing gem5, and a pre-built gem5 binary.
