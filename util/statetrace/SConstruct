To build a version of statetrace suitable to run on a particular ISA, use a
target of the form build/<arch>/statetrace. For example, to build statetrace
for ARM binaries, run:

scons build/arm/statetrace

You may need a cross compiler in order to build statetrace successfully. To
specify an alternative compiler, set the CXX scons argument on the command
line. The CXX environment variable is NOT considered when selecting the
compiler. To override the compiler for a particular target ISA, set the
<arch>CXX scons argument. For example, to build both the AMD64 version and
the ARM version at the same time using the system compiler for the AMD64
version and a cross compiler for arm, your command line would look like the
following:

scons ARMCXX=arm-cross-g++ build/amd64/statetrace build/arm/statetrace

After a successful build, the statetrace binary(binaries) will be located in
the build/<arch>/ directories you specified on the command line.
