/**

 * Declaration of a Re-Reference Interval Prediction replacement policy.
 *
 * Not-Recently Used (NRU) is an approximation of LRU that uses a single bit
 * to determine if an entry is going to be re-referenced in the near or distant
 * future.
 *
 * Re-Reference Interval Prediction (RRIP) is an extension of NRU that uses a
 * re-reference prediction value to determine if entries are going to be re-
 * used in the near future or not.
 *
 * The higher the value of the RRPV, the more distant the entry is from its
 * next access.
 *
 * Bimodal Re-Reference Interval Prediction (BRRIP) is an extension of RRIP
 * that has a probability of not inserting entries as the LRU. This probability
 * is controlled by the bimodal throtle parameter (btp).
 *
 * From the original paper, this implementation of RRIP is also called
 * Static RRIP (SRRIP), as it always inserts entries with the same RRPV.
