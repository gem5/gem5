 * Base class for memory system probes accepting Packet instances.

 * This is a helper base class for memory system probes that
 * instrument Packet handling. Unlike the ProbeListenerObject base
 * class, this class supports instrumentation of multiple ProbeManager
 * instances. However, it's limited to one probe point name. This
 * enables features like tracing or stack distance analysis of packets
 * from multiple components using the same probe. For example, a stack
 * distance probe could be hooked up to multiple memories in a
 * multi-channel configuration.
