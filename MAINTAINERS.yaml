# See CONTRIBUTING.md for details of gem5's contribution process.
#
# This file contains a list of gem5's subsystems and their
# maintainers. The key used to identify a subsystem should be used
# as a tag in commit messages targeting that subsystem. Via our GitHub
# Pull Request system (https://github.com/gem5/gem5/pulls) a maintainer
# of the subsystem impacted by a pull request contribution will be added
# as an assignee to that pull request. Their role is be to referee the
# contribution (add a review, assign reviewers, suggest changes, etc.), then
# merge the contribution into the gem5 develop branch when they are satisfied
# with the change.
#
# Maintainers assigned to a pull request are expected to acknowledge their
# assignment in 2 business days and to fully begin refereeing the contribution
# within a business week.
#
# Maintainers pledge to uphold gem5's community standards and its code of
# conduct by being polite and professional in their interactions with
# contributors. See CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md.
#
# Entries in this file have the following format:
#   key:
#     desc: >-
#       Optional description of the subsystem.
#     status: maintained
#     maintainers:
#       - John Doe <john.doe@gem5.org>
#       - Jane Doe <jane.doe@gem5.org>
#     experts:
#       - Jack Doe <jack.doe@gem5org>
#       - Jill Doe <jill.doe@gem5org>
#
# The status field should have one of the following values:
#   - maintained: The component has an active maintainer.
#   - orphaned: The component is looking for a new owner.
#
# The experts field is optional and used to identify people who are
# knowledgeable about the subsystem but are not responsible for it. Those
# listed as an expert are typically good to add as a reviewer for pull requests
# targeting that subsystem.
