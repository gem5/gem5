The PLY to-do list:

$Header: /home/stever/bk/newmem2/ext/ply/TODO 1.1 03/06/06 14:53:34-00:00 stever@ $

1. Create a Python package using distutils

2. More interesting parsing examples.

3. Work on the ANSI C grammar so that it can actually parse C programs.  To do this,
   some extra code needs to be added to the lexer to deal with typedef names and enumeration
   constants.

4. Get LALR(1) to work.   Hard, but not impossible.

5. More tests in the test directory.

6. Performance improvements and cleanup in yacc.py.

7. More documentation.

8. Lots and lots of cleanup.
