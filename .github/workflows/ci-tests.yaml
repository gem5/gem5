    # We use the date to label caches. A cache is a a "hit" if the date is the
    # request binary and date are the same as what is stored in the cache.
    # This essentially means the first job to run on a given day for a given
    # binary will always be a "miss" and will have to build the binary then
    # upload it as that day's binary to upload. While this isn't the most
    # efficient way to do this, the alternative was to run take a hash of the
    # `src` directory contents and use it as a hash. We found there to be bugs
    # with the hash function where this task would timeout. This approach is
    # simple, works, and still provides some level of caching.
