name: Workflow Scheduler

# GitHub scheduled workflows run on the default branch ('stable' in the case of
# gem5). this means for changes in a workflow to take effect, the default
# branch must be updated. This is not ideal as it requires regular commits into
# the stable branch. Ideally we just want to update the workflow on develop and
# have it run on the develop branch.
#
# This workflow is designed to run on the stable branch and will trigger other
# workflows on the develop branch.
#
# To do so we simply schedule this workflow to run every hour and use some
# simple bash logic to determine if the current time is when we want to run the
# other workflows.
